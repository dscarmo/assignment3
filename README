This is the lander program for assignment 3.
It does almost everything the sample lander program does (kind of worse thrust animations).

My improvements:


-Ship speed report every second
-Ship explosion
-Boundaries make the ship go back instead of being stuck 


The timer and curse codes where based around the codes given by the professor (test_curses and timer.c)
I havent used the ball.c code.

Example of running in terminal: ./lander -g 10 -t -15 -f landscape.txt
