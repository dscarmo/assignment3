This is the lander program for assignment 3.
It does almost everything the sample lander program does (kind of worse thrust animations).

My improvements:


-Ship speed report every second
-Ship explosion
-Boundaries make the ship go back or go to the other side instead of being stuck 


The timer and curse codes where based around the codes given by the professor (test_curses and timer.c)
I havent used the ball.c code.

Example of running in terminal: ./lander -g 10 -t -15 -f landscape.txt
